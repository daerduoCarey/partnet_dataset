## Introduction

We present PartNet: a consistent, large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with fine-grained, instance-level, and hierarchical 3D part information. Our dataset consists of 573,585 part instances over 26,671 3D models covering 24 object categories. This dataset enables and serves as a catalyst for many tasks such as shape analysis, dynamic 3D scene modeling and simulation, affordance analysis, and others. Using our dataset, we establish three benchmarking tasks for evaluating 3D part recognition: fine-grained semantic segmentation, hierarchical semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. We benchmark four state-of-the-art 3D deep learning algorithms for fine-grained semantic segmentation and three baseline methods for hierarchical semantic segmentation. We also propose a novel method for part instance segmentation and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.

## About the Dataset

PartNet is part of the ShapeNet efforts and we provide the PartNet data downloading instructions on [the ShapeNet official webpage](https://shapenet.org/download/parts). You need to become a registered user in order to download the data. Please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetsP7aj-Hy0gvP2FxRT3aTIrc_IMqSqR-5Xl8P3x2awDkQbw/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you have any feedback to us for improving PartNet.

## Data visualization

We make visualization pages for the PartNet data. For the raw annotation (before-merging) one, use [https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/visu_htmls/42/tree_hier.html](https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/visu_htmls/42/tree_hier.html). For the final data (after-merging) one, use [https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/visu_htmls/42/tree_hier_after_merging.html](https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/visu_htmls/42/tree_hier_after_merging.html). Replace 42 with any annotation id for your model.

## Errata

We have tried our best to design the annotation interface, instruct the annotators on providing high-quality annotations and get cross validations among different workers. We also conducted two-round of data verifications to date to elliminate obvious data annotation errors. 
However, provided that annotating such large-scale fine-grained part segmentation is challenging, there could still be some annotation errors in PartNet. We believe that the error rate should be below 1% counted in parts through a rough examination.

Dear PartNet users, we need your help on improving the quality of PartNet while you use it. If you find any problematic annotation, please let us know by filling in [this errata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q_6r9EblZdP9Grhhm2ob4u0FQ8xurAThlgK-qAcjYP0/edit?usp=sharing) for PartNet v0 release. We will fix the errors in the next PartNet release. Thank you!

## Annotation System (3D Web-based GUI)

We release our Annotation Interface in [this repo](https://github.com/daerduocarey/partnet_anno_system).

## PartNet Experiments

Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/daerduocarey/partnet_seg_exps) for the segmentation experiments (Section 5) in the paper.

## TODOs

* We will host online PartNet challenges on 3D shape fine-grained semantic segmentation, hierarchical semantic segmentation and fine-grained instance segmentation tasks. Stay tuned.
* More annotations are coming. Please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetsP7aj-Hy0gvP2FxRT3aTIrc_IMqSqR-5Xl8P3x2awDkQbw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to tell us what annotations you want us to add in PartNet.
* We are integrating PartNet visualization as part of ShapeNet visualization.
